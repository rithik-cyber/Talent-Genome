# 🔬 Talent Genome: ML-Powered Career Pathway Recommender

An AI-driven internal mobility system that uses NLP and machine learning to recommend personalized career paths for employees based on their skill profiles, learning histories, and performance data.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Talent Genome** project aims to support HR and L&D teams in enabling employee growth while minimizing external hiring. By analyzing internal employee records and using Sentence-BERT embeddings combined with clustering and classification, the system predicts role-fit and upskilling pathways with measurable accuracy.
